# crowd-counting-cnn

This implementation is from [Single Image Crowd Counting via MCNN (Unofficial Implementation)](https://github.com/svishwa/crowdcount-mcnn). The author implements MCNN model on Shanghaitech dataset. 

I just modified some details to create UCSD dataset and UCF_50 dataset and test the MCNN model on these dataset.  

I am not sure whether it is okay to upload the modified implementation and if it wrong, contatct me and I will delete it. wqingdaniel@gmail.com.
